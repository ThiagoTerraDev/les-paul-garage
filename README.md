## Project description

https://thiagoterradev.github.io/les-paul-garage/

This project aims to build the online environment of a fictitious company called Les Paul Garage. This shop sells used (and repaired) Les Paul model guitars, and also offers a customization service.

The original design of this project is part of the front-end development course offered by Origamid. I developed and customized this project in order to practice and improve my skills and knowledge. 

Responsive web design approach was applied during the development of this website.
